THE GAME  

This game is a split screen 1v1 racing game where the players race hovercrafts as witches in the swamp, the player can pick up ingredients to craft potions which can give them a boost or the opponent a debuff. The game features one map where the player races against one other player in a local co-op mode. There are "ingredients" spread out along the track, the player can pick them up by driving over them and if they get 3 specific ingredients they can craft a potion. Some potions can be consumed to gain a powerful boost such as a speed boost or immunity to potions thrown by the opponent while others can be thrown to give the opponent a debuff such as temporary blindness or slowness.

The game features a layout of the track in the middle of the split screen with a progress bar to show how far along the track the player is.
